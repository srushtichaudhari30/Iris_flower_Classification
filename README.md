# Iris Flower Classification

It is a machine learning model designed to classify iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The model is trained on the famous Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepals and petals of three iris flower species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.


## Detaset 

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, often used for testing and benchmarking classification algorithms. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on their measurements.
